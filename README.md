# Data_visualization-Gun_Violence

The purpose of this assignment was to get us familiarized with the different visualizations libraries of Python like Matplotlib, Plotly, Cufflinks, etc. It also introduced the idea of using different types of plots for conveying specific types of information.

For this assignment, we worked on the Gun Violence in USA dataset that is available on https://www.kaggle.com/jameslko/gun-violence-data

The dataset was rich with time-series information and we used a lot of trend charts and line charts to plot out intresting findings.
